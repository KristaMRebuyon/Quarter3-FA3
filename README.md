---THE STORY BEHIND THIS WEBSITE:---

Black Ops (CIA Operation Black): 
Welcome, New CIA Agent!
Greetings agent. This is your official guide on using the classified CIA decoding website for covert operations.

Mission Overview: 
You are part of a CIA Black Ops team tasked with infiltrating an enemy facility to retrieve highly classified intelligence. Mission success depends on your ability to decrypt and analyze extracted data.

How It Works: 
- Three encrypted codes are retrieved from enemy data, containing mission-critical intelligence.
- Your task is to decode them using the CIA's advanced decryption system.
- The highest number determines CIA Priority Level, the importance of intelligence.
- The system analyzes data and determines whether the mission was a success, failure, or close call.
- A secret decryption key, a hidden letter, is recovered, unlocking further intelligence.
- Total operation time is calculated to assess how long agents spent in the field.
- A final mission report is generated, providing crucial insights for future operations.

Your Role: 
As a CIA agent, your responsibility is to decode, analyze, and report intelligence. Mission success and national security depend on it.
